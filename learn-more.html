          <h3 class="header -subtitle">Financing Sustainable Cities: Current Challenges and Innovative Approaches</h3>
          <p class="text -plain">Finance is a crucial ingredient for sustainable urban development. In an environment of constrained municipal budgets, finance took center stage when international leaders gathered to support the UN New Urban Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. While cities have a growing range of sustainable investment choices appeal to urban residents, building new or replacing existing sustainable infrastructure is a capital-intensive process that requires substantial upfront investment.</p>

          <h3 class="header -subtitle">Why Aren’t Investments in Sustainable Urban Solutions Happening Faster and at Greater Scale?</h3>
          <p class="text -plain">While investment capital and demand for sustainable solutions are in good supply, according to the New Climate Economy, structuring successful sustainable projects can be a complex, time-consuming process. The challenge is that supply and demand are often mismatched: cities’ sustainable infrastructure projects (the “demand side”) are not seen as viable investment opportunities by the investor community (the “supply side”) as they are too small, or too risky relative to expected returns.</p>
          <p class="text -plain">This is particularly pronounced in emerging markets, where such investments are critical. The mismatch results in too few “bankable” projects, or investment-ready projects that are attractive enough for investors.</p>

          <h3 class="header -subtitle">Financing Sustainable Cities: Current Challenges and Innovative Approaches</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><p class="text -plain">Sustainable projects often involve novel, non-traditional infrastructure assets that fall outside the traditional infrastructure model and therefore have different, sometimes riskier, investment profiles;</p></li>
            <li><p class="text -plain">Key stakeholders are not familiar with alternative infrastructure and service solutions, and lack a common language and space for learning and dialogue on locally suited approaches; and</p></li>
            <li><p class="text -plain">Investment environments, especially policy and regulatory frameworks, are not yet adapted to sustainable approaches.</p></li>
          </ol>

          <h3 class="header -subtitle">Business Models are Shifting Towards Sustainability</h3>
          <p class="text -plain">Successful sustainable urban solutions often involve shifts in existing business models. For example, by purchasing or leasing solar panels, energy users are changing their relationship with energy utilities and can be paid for the power they produce, or earn money from leasing their roof space to a solar company. In urban mobility, travelers can choose to pay a fee for sharing cars and bikes, rather than owning them. Even housing choices are changing as many urban residents are increasingly choosing to live close to public transit over auto-centric suburban living. Such “transit-oriented development” improves people’s access to a variety of services, amenities and job opportunities and helps keep the costs of public infrastructure down.</p>
          <p class="text -plain">Finding new business models, like those mentioned previously, to accelerate and scale up investment in sustainable cities will hinge on answering four key questions: what to invest in, how to pay for it, how to mobilize investment capital and how to structure implementation. These questions matter for any organization delivering a product or service, whether public or private.</p>
          <p class="text -plain">To best answer these questions, three key stakeholders need to develop sustainable solutions together. City decision makers, service providers and investors need to build a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities of different business model choices to ensure cities meet their service objectives, infrastructure and technology providers satisfy their bottom line, and financiers make a return on their investment.</p>

          <h3 class="header -subtitle">Overcoming the Investment Gap</h3>
          <p class="text -plain">Cities are uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable solutions that can positively impact the lives of over half the world’s population. Promising urban service innovations that already exist still need to scale up to their full potential for cities to truly realize the benefits of sustainable urban development. The successful implementation of ambitious investment programs requires shifts in traditional business models that bring public and private interests into alignment. New approaches to developing sound project pipelines are needed to smooth and accelerate the early stage investment process where important knowledge, capacity and interest gaps can exist.</p>

          <h3 class="header -subtitle">Bridging the Gap Between Ideas and Implementation</h3>
          <p class="text -plain">Many sustainable urban projects stall at the idea phase due to a lack of funding, limited internal expertise to pursue new business models, or challenges in coordinating across different public and private sector agencies. The Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative is helping to address each of these challenges to bridge the gap between ideas and implementation.</p>

                <h3 class="header -subtitle -highlighted">Bike-Sharing Systems: A Last-mile Solution for Cities’ Transit Networks</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p class="text -plain -margin"><strong>Cities increasingly recognize the impact bike-sharing systems can have on their broader mobility landscape. In recent years, bike-share has gone viral around the world, with 1 million shared urban bicycles in operation in 2015. The trend started in Europe, expanded to North America and has recently spread to cities in Asia and Latin America.</strong></p>
                <p class="text -plain -margin">Bike-sharing systems are a mode of active mobility used by cities to promote integrated transport systems. Bike-sharing systems allow people the ability to pick up bicycles in one location and return them in another.</p>

                <h3 class="header -subtitle -dark">Challenges</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>Financial sustainability:</strong>
                  Operational cost of bike-sharing systems typically exceed revenue from user charges, which makes it necessary to diversify sources of reliable funding.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Accessibility & safety:</strong>
                   Achieving optimal usage of the system requires a safe cycling environment and a widely accessible system that encourages lower-income ridership.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Service delivery structure:</strong>
                    As a relatively new form of urban mobility, there is still uncertainty as to the best balance of responsibilities between the public and private sector, including ownership and operation.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="header -subtitle -dark -margin-top">Benefits</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>Last-mile connection:</strong>
                   Bike-sharing systems can increase the reach of public transit to cover the beginning or end of individual trips.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Reduced emissions:</strong>
                    Non-motorized mobility improves local air quality and reduces global greenhouse gas emissions.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Traffic relief:</strong>
                     Increasing bicycling through bike sharing options for short trips helps relieve overburdened roads and motorized transit systems. </p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Public health:</strong>
                      Activities like bicycling can reduce the risks of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, which have been linked to sedentary lifestyles. </p></li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="header -subtitle -dark -margin-top">What Business Models Are Cities Using?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>Over 500 city examples of bike-sharing systems identified</p></li>
                  <li><p>30 city bike-share business models analyzed </p></li>
                  <li><p>Practitioner and expert interviews with EnCicla Medellin, Citi Bike NYC, B-Cycle, ECOBICI (Mexico City), Capital Bikeshare Washington D.C., among others.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="header -subtitle -dark -margin-top">Supporting City Initiatives</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>Colombia | </strong>Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative, in collaboration with the Development Bank of Colombia (FINDETER) and the Ministry of Transport of Colombia, provides technical assistance and capacity building to the various Colombian cities in understanding and structuring the business models for their bike-sharing systems.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>India |</strong> Thanks to the Smart Cities Initiative, several Indian cities are now planning city-wide bike-sharing systems. FSCI is supporting the city of Bhopal in structuring their bike-sharing system business model. The launch of this fully automated bike-sharing system of 500 cycles spread across 50 stations is expected in April 2017. </p></li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="header -subtitle -dark -margin-top">Key Findings for Bike Share System Business Models </h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>What to invest in? Scale & access are key factors of success: </strong>Planning bike-share systems at a scale that responds to the city size and is easily accessible is crucial to achieve the desired ridership. Balanced and equitable station placement, coupled with integration with the public transit system, is highly desirable.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>How to pay for it? Blending funding from different sources: </strong>Revenue from user charges is typically complemented with other funding sources, such as selling sponsorship, advertising rights, local environmental taxes and parking fines. Many cities consider bike-sharing systems within the broader public transit system and earmark some public funding to cover operations.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>How to mobilize investment capital? Limited need for public sector finance: </strong>Commercial loans and guarantees are used in some cases, but generally bike-sharing systems have relatively low upfront capital investments compared to other urban mobility options, so it is unlikely that cities will incur debt when choosing bike-sharing systems.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>How to structure implementation? Public-private role differentiation: </strong> Like other public mobility services, city administrations are developing legislation (bicycle plans, traffic regulations, etc.) and providing infrastructure, like bike lanes. Private entities are often in charge of operations and revenue collection, where contracts vary between bundled contracts and those that separate the provision of equipment, bicycles and software provision, to allow for future changes in technology or usage patterns</p></li>
